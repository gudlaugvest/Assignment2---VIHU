# Assignment 2 - unit testing

This assignment is a unit test assignment, the library used is an outdated date library and I am tasked with writing unit test from the functions in ´src/dateUtils.ts´ as well as replacing the outdate library with a newer one in this case \*\*date-fns. I am also tasked with adding type definition to the ´src/dateUtils.ts´ file.

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed before starting the assignment.

## Setup
